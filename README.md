# heart-failure-risk-model
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart failure event using a clinical dataset. We trained a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) on health metrics such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and more, achieving 80%+ accuracy.
